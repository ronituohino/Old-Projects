# Old-projects
A collection of my old projects that never got finished!
All of these projects have been made compatible with Unity 2019.4.1f1.



## Bar
This is a project I started in 2019. It was supposed to be a space bartending game.
I found a cool project called NVIDIA Flex, a system supposed to simulate softbody physics and fluid physics.
I tried to make use of it, but it just didn't co-operate with Unity and it was hard for me to implement any new functionality to it.
After realizing this, and not wanting to create a fluid simulation system from scratch, I scrapped the project :P

## Bar2D
A mayhem co-op game. The idea was that you'd try and keep a bar up and running on a space ship which would face alien attacks, asteroids, raiders and whatnot.
I entered the army while I had this project at works. I got some experience working with the Mirror multiplayer API.

## Bar3D
Hey I'm not obsessed with bars! This was the same idea as above, but in 3d. I quickly switched to 2d to speed up development.

## ChopChop
A mobile game project, about making fruit bowls :D 
A similar game appeared on Google Play after I had started this project so I never finished it.

## Environmental Puzzle
A short puzzle game with a focus on environmental design. Here is one picture about a desert scene. I quickly lost interest after making the physics for moving objects with a mouse.

## Mobile Roguelite
A simple roguelite mobile game. A mix of the Darkest Dungeon and Clash Royale in pixel style!

## Puzzling
I took a shot at creating an adventure game in 2018. My scope was waaaaaay too big!

## RTS-Game
One of my first ever projects, this was started in 2016. I worked on the map generation for a long while, but I hadn't planned on how the rest of game was supposed to work on top of it, and so, I dropped it.

## Thieves and Guards
A very quick game project. I wanted to make a multiplayer game in which there would be people trying to blend in with a crowd of npcs and other people trying to hunt these players. I quickly realized that this was not an original idea and so I stopped working on it. I had fun working with rigidbodies though!

## Top-Down Shooter
I wanted to create something 2D for a change. This project was supposed to be a post-apocalyptic shooting game. I was quite proud of the IK system and the physics system working together on the character.

I also built a procedural city generator. Here are a few images of what it can produce with different settings.

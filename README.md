# Old-projects
A collection of my old projects that never got finished.

## Bar
This is a project I started in 2019. The game was supposed to be a space bartending game, where you would make drinks for customers.
I found a cool project called NVIDIA Flex, a system supposed to simulate softbody physics and fluid physics.
I tried to make use of it, but it just didn't co-operate with Unity and it was hard for me to implement any new functionality to it.
After realizing this, and not wanting to create a fluid simulation system from scratch, I scrapped the project :P

# Old-projects
A collection of my old projects that never got finished

## Bar
This is a project I started in 2019. The game was supposed to be a bartending game, where you would make drinks for customers.
I found a cool project called NVIDIA Flex, a system supposed to simulate softbody physics and fluid physics.
